# StudyJS
Study Group for JavaScript.
This repository is what I teach at the JavaScript study group. We regularly hold study sessions to share my JavaScript skills. I am teaching designers and beginners who need JavaScript how to code 
JavaScript. I am also continuing as an activity to improve my English ability.
