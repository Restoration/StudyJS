## Error
If you render this error, retrieve again by adding _&scope=public_content_ to the parameter at token acquisition.
```
This request requires scope=public_content, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=public_content to be granted this permissions
```

You should change endpoints.If you wanna another endpoints you have to application request.
```
next_max_id and min_id are deprecated for this endpoint; use min_tag_id and max_tag_id instead
```
If you didn't application request you can use endpoint of about self.
